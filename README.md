# tweetmap

The goal of this assignment is to provide you experience in developing and deploying a web application using AWS Cloud
services. Your web application would collect Twitts and do some processing and represent the Twitts on GoogleMaps.
Following are the required steps:  

* Use Twitter Streaming API (Links to an external site.) to fetch tweets from the twitter hose in real-time.
* Use ElasticSearch (Links to an external site.) or AWS CloudSearch (Links to an external site.) to store the tweets on the backend
* Create a web UI that allows users to search for a few keywords (via a dropdown). The keywords (up to 10) can be of your choosing.
* Use Google Maps API  (Links to an external site.)(or any other mapping library) to render these filtered tweets in the map in whatever manner you want.
* Deploy your application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Links to an external site.) in an auto-scaling environment.

> Bonus: Use ElasticSearch’s (Links to an external site.) or CloudSearch’s (Links to an external site.) geospatial 
feature that shows tweets that are within a certain distance from the point the user clicks on the map.
